This was a fun project, despite the short deadline that meant I couldn't add any unit tests.

This is the first time that I've used an LLM for a programming project, and I've found that it is quite useful for boilerplate, especially considering that the hexagonal architecture has a lot of repeating yourself.

Using an LLM has also helped me to learn the hexagonal architecture, by being able to create a practical example fairly quickly.

Initially, I used the LLM sparingly, partly out of the fear of using up the limit of the free plan, and partly because I learn better by doing things myself.


Using the LLM allowed me to finish this on time, at the cost of not completely understanding the codebase.


If I were to do this again, with more time, I would like to have written more of the code myself, or at least fully read the LLM's output.
